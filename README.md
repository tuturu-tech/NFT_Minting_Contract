# Basic NFT Collection Minting Contract

This project was a part of the \_buildspace NFT Collection Minting course. The contract generates three-word SVGs based on an array of words provided and the itemId, then it mints them as on-chain metadata NFTs.

The contract is deployed on the Rinkeby testnet: 0x7928528826bdd1C8De615feB08e852115B12528b

The frontend can be found in the NFT_Minting repository and it is deployed as a Github Page here: https://tuturu-tech.github.io/NFT_Minting/

The NFTs can be checked out on OpenSea (Testnet) here: https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/squarenft-2ksgv8quli
